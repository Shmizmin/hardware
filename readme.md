This is project contains partial Logisim Evolution schematics for a CL8 based CPU. Bugs in Logisim caused me to be basically unable to implement jump instructions and stage-commit instructions (e.g. stb &mem, #imm; push %ip). Most other instructions do technically work, albeit unstably due to my misunderstanding of the quirks of Logisim's gate propagation algorithm. A fresh start is being made here with a Verilog reimplementation which will be much more accurate to the CL8 spec, less buggy, and more feature complete.
